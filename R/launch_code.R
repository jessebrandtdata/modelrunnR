#' Retrieve the code body for a previously-launched run
#'
#' Returns the code that produced `run_id`.
#'
#' For inline runs (`launch({ ... })`), the code body was deparsed and
#' stored on the run row at launch time, so there is only one source
#' to read from.
#'
#' For script runs (`launch("fit.R")`), there are two possible
#' sources: the script file as it currently exists on disk, and the
#' snapshot of the file bytes recorded on the run row at launch time.
#' By default, `launch_code()` reads the file on disk -- the current
#' file *is* the pipeline -- and falls back to the stored snapshot
#' (with a message) when the file has been removed. Pass
#' `from_db = TRUE` to force reading the stored snapshot even when
#' the file is still present: useful for auditing what a historical
#' run actually executed, independent of any later edits.
#'
#' @param run_id A run id as returned (invisibly) by [launch()] or as
#'   found on a `_mr_runs` row.
#' @param from_db If `TRUE`, return the code body stored on the run
#'   row at launch time, even for script-mode runs whose source file
#'   is still on disk. Defaults to `FALSE`.
#'
#' @return A length-one character vector containing the R code.
